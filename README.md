### NASA’S INTEGRATION OF AI FOR MARS ROVER

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company<br/>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration

* When was the company incorporated?<br/>
NASA’S rovers began using a more sophisticated AI on the Curiosity Rover which landed on Mars in 2012. They added an upgrade in 2016 by adding an AI system called AEGIS(Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science)

* Who are the founders of the company?<br/>
NASA JPL’s lab developed AEGIS. The principal investigator was Dr. Tara Estlin. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?<br/>
They created this to enhance the autonomy of the Mars rovers, allowing them to select and analyze scientific targets without waiting for instructions from Earth. They wanted to focus on a software that could make real-time decisions allowing the rovers to identify and prioritize rocks or other geological features. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?<br/>
The company is funded through NASA budgets and from grants. 

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?<br/>
It was built to collect data on rocks and other Martian features that the rover discovers while driving. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?<br/>
The intended customer is the Mars rovers that NASA plans to deploy to Mars. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)<br/>
This program allows the rovers to analyze without waiting for someone to send it a command. 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing; you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)<br/>
The Mars rovers use AEGIS, as well as Autonav that allows it to navigate the terrains without waiting for a command from Earth. They also use the Mars Relay Network that allows the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey to send data between the rovers and Earth.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?<br/>
It is in the Space Exploration field. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?<br/>
Virgin Galactic had a commercial spaceflight where civilians were able to fly to space. SpaceX built  a spacecraft that could be reused, the most notable is the Falcon 9. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?<br/>
There are many other companies that are doing amazing in the space exploration field, the most notable ones besides NASA are SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, Axiom Space, Indian Space Research Organisation, European Space Agency, and the Roscosmos j just to name a few. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?<br/>
NASA employs thousands of people alone by employing people through contracts for private companies and co-ops at universities for research. In 2021, NASA employed more than 19,000. Since 1976, NASA has a site called “Spinoff” where they feature technologies that have been transformed into commercial products. It is a great way to see how everything they developed can be used for other fields as well like the health field. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?<br/>
NASA is still one of the leading agencies in space exploration against both national space agencies and commercial space companies. They are constantly developing cutting-edge technologies that help them with their missions along with helping their partner companies as well. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)<br/>
I would suggest they develop a spacecraft that would allow for in orbit refueling for missions that are far from Earth (i.e. further than the I.S.S). This would allow missions to be extended so we can gather further data. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?<br/>
It would benefit NASA because this would allow them to gain a better insight on other planets and solar systems, and galaxies. If we could extend the lifespan of the missions then it would allow us to gather more information consecutively without having to spend more of our resources and time to build another mission.
