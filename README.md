### NASA’S INTEGRATION OF AI FOR MARS ROVER

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
National Aeronautics and Space Administration

* When was the company incorporated?
NASA’S rovers began using a more sophisticated AI on the Curiosity Rover which landed on Mars in 2012. They added an upgrade in 2016 by adding an AI system called AEGIS(Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science)

* Who are the founders of the company?
NASA JPL’s lab developed AEGIS. The principal investigator was Dr. Tara Estlin. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
They created this to enhance the autonomy of the Mars rovers, allowing them to select and analyze scientific targets without waiting for instructions from Earth. They wanted to focus on a software that could make real-time decisions allowing the rovers to identify and prioritize rocks or other geological features. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company is funded through NASA budgets and from grants. 

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
It was built to collect data on rocks and other Martian features that the rover discovers while driving. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The intended customer is the Mars rovers that NASA plans to deploy to Mars. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
This program allows the rovers to analyze without waiting for someone to send it a command. 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing; you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
The Mars rovers use AEGIS, as well as Autonav that allows it to navigate the terrains without waiting for a command from Earth. They also use the Mars Relay Network that allows the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey to send data between the rovers and Earth.
